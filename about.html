	<b>What is KevSchool?</b><br>
	<p>KevSchool.org is an upcoming nonprofit whose goal is to create and maintain free educational resources on the Internet.</p>

	<b>What is this website?</b><br>
	<p>The KevSchool List of Educational Web Searches is the first project by KevSchool.org.
	It consists of a list of educational topics that can be searched for on the Internet.</p>
	<p>The purpose is to inspire people to learn about topics that they wouldn't otherwise think to search for.</p>
	<p>This is a very simple app, but can be very educational.
	Over time, many more topics and categories will be added.</p>

	<b>Who created KevSchool?</b>
	<p>KevSchool.org was created by Kevin Verre.</p>
	
	<b>How can I suggest new categories or search topics?</b>
	<p>To suggest topics to be added to the list, please contact Kevin. One way you can do that now is to tweet at him on Twitter @KevinVerre</p>

	<b>Isn't this idea really dumb? Or too simple? It's just a list of terms meant to inspire people to learn about them on their own. I doubt anyone would ever use this...</b>
	<p>Although the project is quite simple, I think it could be a very valuable resource. By visiting here, you might spend some time learning about a topic that you otherwise wouldn't research. Or you might discover some new topics that you've never heard of. Even though it is basically just a list of topics to research or learn about, a really good list of topics can be a very good educational resource.</p>

	<b>What is the theme of this website? Is it for general knowledge? Or for computer science and software engineering?</b>
	<p>For now, I have some categories be general knowledge with an emphasis on what is useful or interesting. I also have categories and lots of topics related to software engineering. Simply because I've worked as a software engineer and know a lot of good topics for other software engineers to study.</p>
	<p>Maybe later I will split it up into two different websites, one for general knowledge and one for computer programming.</p>

	<b>Why are you so interested in online educational resources?</b>
	<p>I really like helping people learn things. I'm excited to see what new educational resources become popular online in the future.</p>

	<b>How was KevSchool.org made?</b>
	<p>
	I wrote the HTML and JavaScript for the site. I used the Bootstrap and jQuery libraries. The list of categories and all of the topics in each category are stored in a JavaScript object. When the page loads, a function goes through all of the text strings in that object to generate the links on the page. The links point to Google's search results page with a query parameter (called "q"). The search query value is the text I want to search for on Google, encoded using the encodeURI JavaScript function. I host the website using GitHub pages.

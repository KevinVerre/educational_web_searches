KevSchool.org is an upcoming nonprofit whose goal is to create and maintain free educational resources on the Internet.<br>
<br>
The KevSchool List of Educational Web Searches is the first project by KevSchool.org.<br>
It consists of a list of educational topics that can be searched for on the Internet.<br>
This is a very simple app, but can be very educational.<br>
Over time, many more topics and categories will be added.<br>
<br>	
KevSchool.org was created by Kevin Verre.<br>
<br>
To suggest topics to be added to the list, please contact Kevin.<br>
